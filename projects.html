			<h2>App User Interface</h2>
			<p>Summer 2020 I worked as an intern at a start-up tech company, episode 8, Inc., with the marketing team
				that was creating a new podcast app. As a member of the team, I presented research findings and
				recommended solutions to proposed challenges. With my team, I also had the opportunity to give feedback
				and help design some of the interfaces of the app. Based on consulting with my team, we ideated
				solutions for different problems the user was having with the app. This is one of the interfaces in
				specific that I helped design.</p>

			<h2>Question of the Day</h2>
			<p>When recording your mini podcast with your friend if you needed an icebreaker or a topic of discussion,
				we provided questions of the day to possibly discuss in your new podcast.</p>

			<h2>MySpace Best Friend Inspiration</h2>
			<p>We took inspiration from MySpace and used a similar “Top 8” friends feature in listening to others'
				podcasts. You can switch out who your top podcasters are to refresh your feed.</p>

			<h2>Early Evaluators Program</h2>
			<p>I oversaw the early evaluators program for three platforms and shipped these products to over 200+
				customers, including brands such as Chick-Fil-A, Nordstroms, and Mayo Clinic. EEP helps promote the
				products to customers before launch and helps drive interest in our products. I was in charge of
				communications between customers, prioritized customers on the ship list, created evaluator guides to
				give more information per product, and created surveys to provide feedback.</p>
			<h2>Sustainability Analysis</h2>
			<p>This summer, within the retail business unit, I worked closely with sustainability experts. I made a
				sustainability dashboard via Power BI to see if retail was on track to meet our recycled plastic goals.
				I led a sustainability prediction analysis on our recycled plastic goals for the next ten years. I
				presented this analysis at an executive level to inform whether we are on track or not on track for our
				sustainability goals. One of my most significant lasting impacts from this project is that my findings
				and analysis template are used in other business units to evaluate their sustainability goals.</p>
			<h2>Business Use Cases</h2>
			<p>I created vertical use case-specific customer slides for our sales team to present to customers. I made
				vertical use case slides for retail, hospitality, and healthcare. Although hospitality and retail are
				critical, our team recently saw a huge opportunity to move into banking and healthcare, so I
				collaborated with experts on the business development team to sell and promote our product to those
				specific customers.</p>
