		<div class="aboutme">
			<p>My name is Addison Gale. I am a junior at the University of Michigan studying at the School of Information with a focus in user experience. I am a proven leader, diligent team player, and collaborative innovator with the curiosity to discover, and the resiliency to achieve goals.</p>
			<p>I'm passionate aboutÂ learning about new technology trends so that I may work more efficiently and witness growth and success. Technology has the potential to have a profound impact on people's lives on a scale that has never been seen before in human history. My fascination with technology stems from the possibility that whatever I build could have a global influence now or in the future.</p>
